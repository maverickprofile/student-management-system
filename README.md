# Student Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application that allows users to:
- **Register & Login**: Users must create an account before accessing the system.
- **Manage Students**: Users can add, view, update, and delete student records.
- **Authentication System**: Each user's student data is stored separately.
- **Exception Handling**: Prevents invalid inputs and ensures smooth execution.
- **Multi-threading**: Uses synchronized methods for thread safety.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java (Core Java, OOPs, Collections, Exception Handling, Multithreading)**
